[![build status](https://gitlabext.iag.uni-stuttgart.de/flexi/flexi/badges/master/build.svg)](https://gitlabext.iag.uni-stuttgart.de/flexi/flexi/builds/)

Flexi is a high-order numerical framework for solving PDEs,
with a focus on Computational Fluid Dynamics.
Flexi based on the Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element
Method (DGSEM), which allows for high-order of accuracy 
and fully unstructured hexahedral meshes.
The solver is parallelized very efficiently and scales up
to hundreds of thousand cores.

Flexi has been developed by the [Numerics Research Group (NRG)][nrg]
lead by Prof. Claus-Dieter Munz at the Institute of Aerodynamics
and Gasdynamics at the University of Stuttgart, Germany.

This is a scientific project. If you use Flexi for publications or
presentations in science, please support the project by citing
our publications given in [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).
