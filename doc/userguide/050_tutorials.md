# Tutorials \label{chap:tutorials}

This chapter will give a detailed overview of flow simulations with **FLEXI**. It assumes that you are familiar with how to set the compiler options and how to compile the code. It also assumes that you either have set the environment variables for **flexi** and **flexi2vtk** as described in \ref{sec:compilingthecode} _or_ that you copy or link these binaries to the folder you are working from. 

Before you can start with your first tutorial, you have to ensure that you have compiled your code with the cmake flag

~~~~~~
FLEXI_TUTORIALS = ON .
~~~~~~
You might want to consider creating a specific build directory for this purpose. If you compile with this setting, a folder ``tutorials`` will be generated in the main directory of Flexi containing subfolders for each tutorial.

Each tutorial is equipped with .ini files *parameter_hopr.ini* and *parameter_flexi.ini* as well as mesh file *\*\_mesh.h5* in HDF5 format (created with **HOPR**).

~~~~~~
parameter_hopr.ini
parameter_flexi.ini
mesh.h5
~~~~~~
 
We suggest to copy each folder to a new directory, where you can run and modify the "INI-files". Also, link the **flexi** and **flexi2vtk** executables into that folder, if you have not set the appropriate environment variables.
