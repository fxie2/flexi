## Flow around a NACA 0012 airfoil

In this tutorial, the simulation around a NACA 0012 airfoil at $Re=5000$ and $Ma=0.4$ is considered. First, we explain how to set the main flow parameters. We then describe the evaluation of lift and drag and visualization of the flow field. Finally, we show how to use the *sponge zone* to remove artificial reflections from the outflow boundary, so that a clean acoustic field is retained.

Table: Cmake options for the NACA 0012 simulation. \label{tab:naca0012_cmakeoptions}

The standard settings are sufficient for this example. To check whether they are set, change to your ``build`` folder and open the cmake GUI 

~~~~~~~~~~~
ccmake [flexi root directory]
~~~~~~~~~~~

If necessary, set the above options and then compile the code by issuing

~~~~~~~~~~~
make
~~~~~~~~~~~


### Mesh Generation with HOPR

The mesh file used by **FLEXI** is created from the external linear mesh ``NACA0012_652.cgns`` and a 3rd order boundary description ``NACA0012_652_splitNg2.cgns`` using **HOPR**

    ./hopr parameter_hopr.ini

This creates the mesh file *NACA0012_652_Ng2_mesh.h5* in HDF5 format. If **HOPR** is not available, the mesh file is supplied in this tutorial.

### Flow Simulation with FLEXI

The simulation setup is defined in ``parameter_flexi.ini``. The initial condition is selected via the variable vector ``RefState=(/1.,0.990268069,0.139173101,0.,4.4642857/)`` which represents the vector of primitive solution variables $(\rho, u, v, w, p)^T$. The chosen velocity vector $(u,v)^T$ yields an angle of attack of $\alpha=4^\circ$ and a velocity magnitude of 1. The first supplied ``RefState`` is given the number 1, the second is given the number 2 and so on.

``IniRefState = 1`` : the initial condition uses ``RefState 1`` for the initial flow field solution.

``IniExactFunc = 1`` : exact function routine for initialization, case 1 initializes a freestream state based on ``IniRefState``.

Material properties are given in table \ref{tab:naca0012_materialproperties}. Based on the ideal gas law, we get

$$Ma=1/\sqrt{\kappa p/\rho}=0.4$$

Note that in this non-dimensional setup the mesh is scaled such that the chord length is unity, i.e. $C=1$. Then to arrive at $Re=\rho u C / \mu = 5000$, the viscosity is set to

$$ \mu = \rho u C / Re = 1/Re = 0.0002 $$


| Property                        | Variable      | Value       |
| ------------------------------- |:-------------:| -----------:|
| dynamic viscosity $\mu$         | mu0           | 0.0002      |
| ideal gas constant $R$          | R             |  4.4642857  |
| Prandtl number                  | Pr            |  0.72       |
| isentropic coefficient $\kappa$ | kappa         |  1.4        |

### Numerical settings

The DG solution on the mesh is represented by piecewise polynomials and the polynomial degree in this tutorial is chosen as $N=3$.

The main code settings are displayed in table \ref{tab:naca0012_num_set}. 


| Variable        | Description                            | Value         |
| --------------- |:---------------------------------------|--------------:|
| N               | Polynomial degree                      | 3             |
| MeshFile        | Mesh file to be used                   |NACA0012_1168_Ng2_mesh.h5|

| DFLscale        |                                        | 0.9           |

### Boundary conditions

The boundary conditions were already set in the mesh file by **hopr**. Thus, the simulation runs without specifying the boundary conditions in the **FLEXI** parameter file. The freestream boundaries of the mesh are Dirichlet boundaries using the same state as the initialization, e.g. ``IniRefState`` by default.

The boundary types and states used by the simulations can always be checked in the initial console output of **FLEXI**. In order to run a quick test run, first set

~~~~~~~
maxiter=1
~~~~~~~

in your parameter file to enforce the simulation to stop after one time step. Then run the code

~~~~~~~
$FLEXI_DIR/flexi parameter_flexi.ini
~~~~~~~

The code will finish after one time step. The initialization output contains the boundary conditions

~~~~~~~
         Name      Type     State     Alpha
       BC_wall         3         0         0
     BC_inflow         2         0         0
    BC_outflow         2         0         0
     BC_zminus         1         0         1
      BC_zplus         1         0        -1
~~~~~~~

Type 2 identifies the weak Dirichlet boundary condition, type 3 the adiabatic wall. The boundary conditions in $z$ direction are not relevant for this 2D example and are realized as periodic boundaries.

Suppose we want to change the wall boundary condition from adiabatic to isothermal.

* This is done by first defining a second RefState. Add to the parameter file the second of the following lines

    ~~~~~~~
    RefState=(/1.,0.990268069,0.139173101,0.,4.4642857/)
    RefState=(/1.,0.990268069,0.139173101,0.,4.9107143/)
    ~~~~~~~
    
    Note that in the second RefState the pressure was increased by 10\%. From the ideal gas law, we then know that the temperature also is raised by 10\%, since the density has been kept constant. Also note that the isothermal wall ignores the velocity components but only uses the thermodynamic quantities.

* Second, overwrite the initial wall boundary condition

    ~~~~~~~
    BoundaryName=BC_wall
    BoundaryType=(/4,2/)
    ~~~~~~~

    Here, 4 implies the use of the isothermal boundary condition and 2 indicates the RefState to be used for the wall. Note that the temperature is set indirectly by the RefState given in terms of $\rho$ and $p$. 
    
To check the newly set boundary condition, run the code once more for one iteration. The output should now look like this

~~~~~~~
      Boundary in HDF file found |  BC_wall
                             was |  3 0
                       is set to |  4 2
..................................................
         Name      Type     State     Alpha
       BC_wall         4         2         0
     BC_inflow         2         0         0
    BC_outflow         2         0         0
     BC_zminus         1         0         1
      BC_zplus         1         0        -1
~~~~~~~

Now the wall boundary condition is isothermal using the temperature defined by the second ``RefState`` listed in your parameter file. A complete overview over the boundary conditions and how to use them is given in Section \ref{sec:boundaryconditions}.

Before starting your simulation, remember to disable the ``maxiter`` line again by setting it to -1.

### Running the code 
We proceed by running the code in parallel. For example using 4 processors, use the following command

~~~~~~~
mpirun -np 4 $FLEXI_DIR/flexi parameter_flexi.ini
~~~~~~~

On a 2012 laptop with core i5 processor, this simulation takes about 40 minutes.

### Evaluation of the lift and drag forces

The forces acting on the airfoil are one of the main desired output quantities from the simulation. They are calculated on the fly during runtime. The associated flags in the parameter file are

~~~~~~~~~~~~
CalcBodyForces=T
WriteBodyForces=T
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first line activates the calculation of the forces at each ``Analyze_dt``, the second line enforces output of the forces to a ``.dat`` file.

The body forces are a good measure for convergence. In the context of time-dependent flows this determines whether the solution has reached a quasi steady state. The following plot shows the $x$ and $y$ components of the force acting on the airfoil until ``TEnd=10``.

![Resulting forces on the airfoil up to $t=10$.\label{fig:naca0012_bodyforces}](tutorials/03_naca0012/naca0012_bodyforces.png)

The lift and drag coefficients can be easily calculated by rotating these forces from the computational reference frame to the one of the freestream.

From the forces, it is clear that the steady state has not yet been reached and the simulation must be run further. Before we proceed with the simulation, we will nonetheless examine the preliminary results to check the quality of the simulation.

### Wall velocities
Due to the weak coupling between the grid cells and to boundaries, boundary conditions are enforced weakly, e.g. by applying a specific flux. This adds largely to the stability of the scheme. However, as a result the no-slip condition at the wall is not exactly fulfilled by the numerical solution. Rather, it is approximated as far as the resolution allows. 

Evaluation of the velocity vector near the wall helps quantifying this error, which can be seen as a quality measure for the near wall resolution. In the parameter file, the computation and output to a ``.dat`` file of the average and extreme values of the wall velocity at every ``Analyze_dt`` are activated by setting

~~~~~~~~~~~~
CalcWallVelocity=T
WriteWallVelocity=T
~~~~~~~~~~~~

During the computation, we get output like the following:

~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Wall Velocities (mean/min/max)  : 
       BC_wall   2.737875251E-02   3.639096145E-04   6.228999317E-01
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In our case, the wall velocity is on average at about 3\% of the freestream velocity, reaching a peak of 60\%. This peak typically occurs at the quasi-singularity at the trailing edge. To decrease this deviation from the theoretical no-slip condition, either the wall-normal mesh size must be decreased or the polynomial degree increased. 

It is important to note that both of the above measures will, besides increasing the number of degrees of freedom, *decrease the time step*, which directly affects the computational time. Thus, it is important to achieve an acceptable trade-off between the acceptable error and the computational time.

In this tutorial, the observed slip velocity is deemed uncritical and we proceed with the same resolution.

### Visualization \label{sec:naca0012_visualization}

To visualize the solution, the *State*-files must be converted into a format suitable for **Paraview**. Issue the command 

~~~~~~~
mpirun -np 4 $FLEXI_DIR/flexi2vtk --NVisu=6 NACA0012_State_0000*.h5
~~~~~~~
to generate the corresponding *vtu*-files using supersampling with $(NVisu+1)^3$ points in each cell. The *vtu* file can then be loaded into **Paraview**. The following figure shows a visualization of the density at $t=10$. The levels of $0.99<\rho<1.01$ are chosen to reveal the acoustic radiation from the airfoil.

![Contours of density with $0.99<\rho<1.01$ at $t=10$ for the flow around a NACA 0012 airfoil.\label{fig:naca0012_acoustic_t10}](tutorials/03_naca0012/naca0012_acoustic_t10.png)

The large scale vortex shedding of the wake due to the high angle of attack is clearly visible. Acoustic radiation from the airfoil can also be observed.

Now, a problem becomes apparent: the vortex street propagating towards the outflow boundary results in a second, artificial acoustic source at the outflow boundary. This is one of the fundamental problems in direct aeroacoustic computations. Before we proceed with the simulation, we will now make use of the sponge zone functionality of **FLEXI** to remove this artificial source.

### Remove outflow reflections using the sponge zone

The sponge zone introduces a dissipative source term to the discrete operator, which is only active in a user-specified region, typically upstream of the outflow boundary. We use the sponge zone to dampen the vortices convected downstream before they hit the outflow boundary. See [@flad2014discontinuous] for the background of our sponge zone implementation. 

In order to activate the sponge zone, set

~~~~~~~
SpongeLayer=T
~~~~~~~

in the parameter file.

Most of the other parameters are already set for the current simulation:

Table: Sponge settings \label{tab:naca0012_sponge_set}

The source term is of the form

\begin{equation}
\tilde{U}_t=U_t - d\sigma(\vec{x}) \left( U-U_B \right)
\end{equation}

First, ``damping`` determines the strength of the source term, i.e. $d$ in the above equation. It is dependent on the mean convection velocity, the desired amount of amplitude reduction and the thickness of the sponge zone. Typically, some trial and error is necessary to obtain an appropriate value. In non-dimensional calculations, i.e. velocity and length scale are of $\mathcal{O}(1)$, $d=0.1 ... 2$.

Ramping of the source term from 0 is necessary to avoid reflections at the sponge interface. If such reflections occur, it is necessary to choose a thicker sponge ramp so that the source term is ramped up less steeply. We choose a parallel ramp by setting ``SpongeShape=1``. The ramp's starting position, thickness and direction are set by ``xStart``, ``SpongeDistance`` and ``SpongeDir``, respectively. These parameters govern the shape function $\sigma(\vec{x})$ which smoothly ramps the source term from 0 to 1. 

It is important to emphasize that the regions where the source term is active should not be interpreted physically. They should be considered a part of the boundary condition. Likewise, they must be placed sufficiently far downstream of the airfoil such that they do not influence the near field solution. With the chosen settings, the sponge zone starts one chord behind the airfoil and is ramped up to 1 at the outflow boundary, located 4 chords behind the airfoil.

In order to visualize the ramping function $d\sigma(\vec{x})$, set ``SpongeViz=T``. For that purpose, change the project name to e.g. "test" and set ``maxiter=1`` to immediately stop the simulation after one iteration. This will output a .vtu file ready for visualization. After that, don't forget to change back the project name and reset ``maxiter=-1``.

Now, we have to choose the desired baseflow ($U_B$). For the current configuration, the moving average (``SpongeBaseFlow=4``) is appropriate. It produces a mean field slowly progressing in time, which adapts to the potential flow around the airfoil. The parameter ``tempFilterWidth`` determines the effective time window for the moving average. It should be chosen somewhat larger than the largest time scales to be damped. Its value of 2.0 here is chosen based on the frequency of the oscillations in the body forces seen in Figure \ref{fig:naca0012_bodyforces}.

The moving average base flow needs an initial value. One option is to provide an initial flow field from a file using the ``SpongeBaseflowFile`` parameter. If this parameter is not set, the code will initialize the base flow with the same values as the solution itself. Thus, in the case of a fresh computation, the base flow will be initialized with the ``IniExactFunc`` used to initialize the solution. In the case of a restart, like in the present tutorial, the base flow will be initialized with the state file provided for the restart of the simulation.

Note that using the moving average baseflow, the code will dump additional *\*baseflow\*.h5* files to the hard drive, which are necessary to restart the simulation with the corresponding base flow from a given time. If these files are available and exhibit the same project name as the current simulation, the code automatically detects the right base flow file to initialize the base flow at the restart time. However, if in that situation ``SpongeBaseflowFile`` is still provided in the parameter file, the moving average will be *restarted using the flow field provided in the parameter file*, which may not be desirable.

### Restarting the simulation

If the simulation run is interrupted or if you decide to run the simulation further than ``TEnd=10``, **FLEXI** can easily be restarted. In the current setting, the code dumps the solution in $0.1$ time units intervals. Since we want to progress our simulation further, set ``TEnd=25`` in the parameter file. Since we have now turned on the sponge zone, it is also advisable to modify the project name, i.e.

~~~~~~~~~
ProjectName=NACA0012_Re5000_AoA4_SP
~~~~~~~~~

If the state files are in the current folder, restart the simulation as follows

~~~~~~~
mpirun -np 4 $FLEXI_DIR/flexi parameter_flexi.ini NACA0012_Re5000_AoA4_State_0000010.000000000.h5
~~~~~~~

Note that it is also possible to change the polynomial degree of the simulation during restart. This can be used to generate a rough initial solution at low $N$ and then switch to a high quality approximation at higher $N$ later. The code will automatically project the solution onto the new polynomial basis at startup. Restart is however only possible using the *same mesh file*.

Once the simulation is done, visualize the results again following the instructions in Section \ref{sec:naca0012_visualization}.

The following two figures show the resulting instantaneous density contours with (Figure \ref{fig:naca0012_acoustic_SP_t25}, $t=25$) and without sponge zone (Figure \ref{fig:naca0012_acoustic_woSP_t20}, $t=20$). Clearly, the source at the outflow is damped to uncritical levels. Fine-tuning of the sponge parameters may improve the results.

Another look at the body forces indicates that a quasi-steady state has been reached.
